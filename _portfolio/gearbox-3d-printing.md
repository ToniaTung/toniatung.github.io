## Project Context

This work was completed as part of a **course-based mechanical design and fabrication project**
that consisted of **two independent team projects**:

1. **Triathlon robot project** (competition-based robotic system)
2. **Bridge design project** (structural CAD design and fabrication)

Both projects emphasized **hands-on mechanical prototyping**, **team collaboration**,
and **design-for-fabrication workflows**.

This page documents **only the components and tasks I personally contributed to**,
and explicitly excludes work performed by other teammates.

**Project Type:** Course project (team-based)  
**Application Domain:** Mechanical design and prototyping  
**Focus Areas:** CAD drafting, mechanical assembly, and build integration  

---

## My Role and Contributions

My role focused on **mechanical drafting support and physical system assembly**.
My contributions differed across the two projects and are clearly separated below.

---

### Bridge Design Project

For the bridge project, my contributions included:

- **CAD drafting and drawing preparation** for bridge components  
  (co-developed with one teammate)
- Supporting **team-based assembly and fabrication**, including part fitting
  and build coordination

I did **not** work independently on structural analysis or optimization;
assembly was performed collaboratively as a team.

---

### Triathlon Robot Project

For the triathlon robot project, my contributions included:

- **Hands-on mechanical assembly** of the robot platform as part of the team
- Assisting with **system integration and build readiness**
- Contributing **a very small amount of CAD drafting** for a float
  (pontoon-related) component

I did **not** participate in gearbox design, drivetrain modeling,
or primary mechanical architecture decisions.

## System Overview

### Bridge Design Track

The bridge project focused on:
- Translating conceptual designs into **clear CAD drawings**
- Coordinating fabrication through shared design documentation
- Supporting assembly and integration during the build phase

---

### Triathlon Robot Track

The triathlon robot served as a competition platform and required:
- Mechanical assembly and component integration
- Coordination between subsystems for fit, mounting, and reliability
- Iterative build and testing under time constraints

---

## What I Implemented

### Bridge Project: CAD Drafting and Assembly Support

**Scope:** CAD drafting + team assembly support

My work included:
- Producing and refining CAD drawings for bridge components
- Updating drawings based on fabrication and assembly feedback
- Assisting with assembly to ensure correct part alignment and fit

---

### Triathlon Robot: Assembly and Minor CAD Contribution

**Scope:** Assembly + limited CAD drafting

My work included:
- Participating in mechanical assembly and integration of the robot
- Supporting troubleshooting during physical build stages
- Drafting a small floating component used in the system

---

## Outcomes and Impact

My contributions supported:

- Clear and usable CAD documentation for bridge fabrication
- Smooth team-based assembly progress across both projects
- Improved integration efficiency through hands-on build support

These projects strengthened my experience in **team-based mechanical prototyping**,
**CAD drafting for fabrication**, and **real-world system integration**.
