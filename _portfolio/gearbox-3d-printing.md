## Project Context

This project was conducted as a **course-based mechanical and mechatronic system design project**
centered on the development of a triathlon robot for competitive evaluation.

**Project Type:** Mechanical system design & fabrication  
**Application Domain:** Mobile robotic platforms  
**Problem Focus:** Load-bearing design, power transmission, and manufacturability  

The triathlon robot served as the **primary competition system**, with performance evaluated
based on mechanical reliability, structural integrity, and task execution.

This page documents **only the mechanical subsystems I personally designed,
fabricated, and tested** within the overall robot platform.

## My Role and Contributions

I was responsible for the **mechanical design and fabrication** of key load-bearing
and transmission subsystems of the triathlon robot.

My contributions include:

- Designing **custom gearbox and transmission components** to meet torque and load requirements
- Developing **lightweight truss-based structural components** for mechanical support
- Optimizing **strength-to-weight ratio** through iterative CAD design
- Fabricating components using **additive manufacturing**
- Participating in mechanical assembly and physical testing of fabricated parts

My work focused on ensuring **mechanical reliability, manufacturability,
and structural performance** under competition constraints.

## System Overview

The triathlon robot consists of multiple integrated mechanical subsystems
designed to support locomotion and task execution.

The system includes:

- A mobile robot chassis serving as the primary competition platform
- Custom-designed gearbox for torque amplification
- Load-bearing truss structures fabricated via 3D printing
- Mechanical interfaces for motor mounting and structural integration

## Mechanical Design and Fabrication

### Gearbox Design

I designed a **custom gearbox** to achieve the required output torque
for competition tasks.

Key design considerations included:

- Torque transmission efficiency
- Gear alignment and structural support
- Compact geometry compatible with the robot chassis
- Manufacturability using additive manufacturing

The gearbox was modeled, fabricated, and tested as part of the integrated system.

### Structural and Truss Components

To support the mechanical loads of the robot, I designed
**truss-based structural components** with an emphasis on:

- Reducing overall system weight
- Maintaining sufficient rigidity under load
- Ensuring ease of assembly and maintenance

All components were fabricated using **3D printing** and evaluated
through physical testing during system integration.

## Outcomes and Impact

My contributions enabled:

- Reliable mechanical performance during competition tasks
- Effective torque transmission through custom-designed gear mechanisms
- Lightweight yet robust structural support for the robot platform
- Successful deployment of additively manufactured parts in a functional robotic system

This project strengthened my experience in **mechanical system design,
fabrication, and real-world validation under competitive constraints**.
