## Overview
Designed and built a triathlon robot integrating mechanical structure, custom gear transmission,
and load-bearing systems. The robot was the primary competition exhibit, with subsystem designs
(gearbox and truss structures) developed to optimize performance, reliability, and manufacturability.

## Overview
Designed and built a triathlon robot integrating mechanical structure, custom gear transmission,
and load-bearing systems. The robot was the primary competition exhibit, with subsystem designs
(gearbox and truss structures) developed to optimize performance, reliability, and manufacturability.

## System Architecture
The system consists of three major subsystems:
- A triathlon robot platform responsible for locomotion and task execution
- Lightweight truss-based structures fabricated using additive manufacturing
- 
## Triathlon Robot (Primary Competition System)
- Designed the overall robot structure, mechanical layout, and actuation strategy
- Integrated DC motor drive with custom gearbox to achieve sufficient output torque
- Optimized weight distribution for stability during competition tasks
- Robot performance served as the primary evaluation criteria in competition
