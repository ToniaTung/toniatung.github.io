My name is Chiao-Jo (Tonia) Tung. I am currently a master student at the **University of Michigan Mechanical Engineering Department**. I previously earned my **B.S. in Biomechatronics Engineering** from **National Taiwan University (NTU)**.

My academic background lies at the intersection of **machine learning, computer vision, and mechatronic systems**, with hands-on research experience in **deep learning–based object detection, image classification, and intelligent automation systems**. I have developed end-to-end AI pipelines using **YOLOv7, ResNet18, and Python-based data processing frameworks**, with applications ranging from biological image analysis to semiconductor layout-to-image inference.
