## About Me

**Mechanical engineering graduate student with a strong interdisciplinary background in machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. Experienced in building end-to-end AI-driven systems and mechatronic prototypes, from deep learning–based perception to embedded and hardware integration. Seeking opportunities in advanced automation, intelligent systems, and applied AI engineering.**

My name is Chiao-Jo (Tonia) Tung. I am currently a Master student at the **University of Michigan Mechanical Engineering Department**. Prior to that, I received my **B.S. in Biomechatronics Engineering** from **National Taiwan University (NTU)**, where I was advised by **Prof. Yan-Fu Kuo** in the Lab of **Machine Learning and Machine Vision** at NTU.
